## About me
I graduated from an information science university and am now a graduate student in the same field. My undergraduate thesis was in financial engineering, and after the server storing it was hit by a cyber attack, I managed to recover it myself, gaining deep knowledge in security. Now, I use YubiKey for device management.

I enjoy developing web apps and data analysis. Iâ€™ve created a wiki with friends and built a todo app for my mom.
